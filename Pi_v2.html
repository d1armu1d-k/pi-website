  <h1>π</h1>

  <p>
    Pi (π) is a mathematical constant used to calculate the circumference and area of circles...
    ..PI. pi is a infinete number this is pi.3.1415926535. Pi (π) is a mathematical constant used to calculate the circumference and area of circles,
 and it also appears in various other mathematical and scientific formulas. Its value is approximately 3.1415926535. Pi represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
 It is an irrational and transcendental number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.
 Pi has been calculated to trillions of digits, and while its value is essential for many calculations, especially in geometry and physics, the exact value can never be fully determined.
 The number pi is integral to our understanding of geometry. The symbol for Pi has been in use for over 250 years. The symbol was introduced by William Jones, a Welsh mathematician, in 1706.
 The symbol was made popular by the mathematician Leonhard Euler.Since the exact value of pi can never be calculated, we can never find the accurate area or circumference of a circle.
 March 14 or 3/14 is celebrated as pi day because 3.14 are the first digits of pi. Math nerds around the world love celebrating this infinitely long, never-ending number.
 The record for reciting the most number of decimal places of Pi was achieved by Rajveer Meena at VIT University, Vellore, India on 21 March 2015. He was able to recite 70,000 decimal places.
 To maintain the sanctity of the record, Rajveer wore a blindfold throughout the duration of his recall, which took an astonishing 10 hours! The usefulness of pi has been a matter of debate,
 although it is loved by a lot of math enthusiasts. Some believe that tau (which amounts to 2π) is a better suited to circle calculations. For instance,
 you can multiply tau with the radius of a to calculate its circumference more intuitively. Tau/4 also represents the angle of a quarter of a circle.
 In the Exploratorium science museum, a circular parade happens every year on pi day. Each person participating holds one digit in the number pi.
 It wasn’t celebrated around the United States like it is now until Congress passed Resolution 224, which designated March 14th as pi day.
 Congress hoped that celebrating pi day would cultivate a higher level of enthusiasm for math and science among American students.The calculation of pi is a stress test for a computer.
 It works just like a digital cardiogram since it indicates the level of activity within the computer’s processor.Givenchy sells a men’s cologne with the name ‘Pi’.
 The company markets this product as capable of enhancing the attractiveness of intelligent and visionary men. The number pi is not just an important part of conversations among mathematicians or students.
 In the famous O.J. Simpson trial, the defense attorney and FBI agent’s argument revolved around the value of pi.
 The FBI agent’s findings in the case weren’t accurate because he used pi inaccurately.he number pi was so alluring,
 even in the 16th century, that Dutch-German mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen spent most of his life calculating the first 36 digits of pi.
 It is said that the first 36 numbers were engraved on his tombstone, which is now lost. The number pi is literally infinitely long. But the number 123456 doesn’t appear anywhere in the first million digits of pi.
 It is a bit shocking because if a million digits of pi don’t have the sequence 124356, it definitely is the most unique number.In ancient times, mathematicians used a unique method to calculate pi.
 They would add more and more sides to a polygon so that its area approached the area of a circle. Archimedes, the most famous Greek mathematician and inventor, used a polygon with 96 sides.
 Many other mathematicians also used this polygon-method to compute the infinitely long number pi. In China, a mathematician used over 3,000 sides in a polygon to arrive at the value 3.14159.
 Another mathematician used about 25,000 sides to calculate pi. The number pi is very effective when you used in calculations For instance,
 rounding the number pi to just 9 digits after the decimal and use it to calculate earth’s circumference yield incredibly accurate results.
 For every 25,000 miles, the number pi will only err to 1/4th of an inch.Even today, people are racing to calculate more digits of pi in a never ending competition. In the year 2010
 a Japanese engineer and an American computer wizard broke the record for the most number of pi digits by calculating up to 5 trillion digits of pi.
 The amazing part is that they didn’t use any supercomputers. They just used desktop computers, 20 external hard disks, and their brilliant minds
 .The Greek letter π is the first letter of the word periphery and perimeter. And as we all know, pi is the ratio of a circle’s “periphery” to its diameter.Interestingly,
 some of the most famous scientists in the world have a connection to pi day. Albert Einstein was born on March 14th,
 1879. Stephen Hawking died on March 15th, 2018 at the age of 76.
    It’s celebrated on March 14th, and used in everything from geometry to perfume ads to court cases!
